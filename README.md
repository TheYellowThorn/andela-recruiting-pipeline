### Description

This application is built using the React framework.  The reasoning behind the use of the React framework is that it provides quick front end prototyping and has a large community providing third-party libraries.  Additionally, it is my understanding many of the applications within Andela are built using React, and I thought this framework would be the most applicable to the company's current development habits.

### Libraries Used

#### json-server

This library allows us to mock api calls without building a back end.

#### react-chartjs-2

This library provides several chart component options that are used in the application to display various anayltics and metrics.

#### react-datepicker

Provides a Datepicker component for quick date selection prototyping
